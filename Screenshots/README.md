#Monogame projects:
Voronoi cell island generator: WPF application that generates a procedural island using Voronoi Cells, and displays the result in a top down view.

3D island generator: Uses Monogame Framework (http://www.monogame.net/) and my island generator to render the island in the 3D using a 'low-poly' style.

#Custom OpenTK engine projects:
Hex map UI Selector: Little hex-based 'game' using my OpenTK based engine. Demonstrates UI elements.

Hex map and A*: Shows a few buildings and the A* roads between buildings (Please excuse the programmer art)

QuadTree and hitboxes: Uses a quadtree to calculate physics on many objects simultaneously. Object hitboxes and quadtree bounds are displayed.
